Hi, I’m Brooke!

I work for Nebraska Furniture Mart as an Administrative Specialist in the Appliance Contractor Sales Division. My position is a mixture of admin, sales, and customer service. Homebuilders will send their clients in to our office to get help selecting their new kitchen and/or laundry appliances. We’ll manage their accounts and orders with us while also giving them and their clients the best deals around! If you’re a business customer and looking for a deal, you’ll likely encounter either myself or one of my colleagues. 

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree from Fontbonne University with a major in Advertising and a minor in Graphic Design. I’m also pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree from Bellevue University, majoring in Web Development. 

In my free time, I love spending time with my family. We’re always looking for fun new experiences for the kiddo to enjoy!
